## Requirement
1. Python on the system.
2. You are in Vancouver time<br>
(if you have a different time zone and cannot change it, refer to [Dhawal Rathore's fork](https://github.com/dhawal-rathore/xlsx_to_ics-UBC-Workday)
## How to use
Put xlsx file from Workday and the xlsx_to_ics.py in the same folder (if you just downloaded them, they are probably already both inside the Downloads folder)
Open up terminal and enter:
```
cd ~/Downloads
```
Or any other folder as long as the two files are in them, and you are running the following line inside that folder:
```
python3 xlsx_to_ics.py
```
